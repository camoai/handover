## üìÇ Contribution Guidelines

You can contribute your work to this organization in two ways:

---

### üõ† Option 1: Full Project Repository

If you have been developing your project in a **personal GitHub repository**, you can transfer or clone it into this organization.

#### Steps:

1. Ask the admin for access to the organization.
2. Clone your personal repo into the org:

   ```bash
   git clone --mirror https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   cd your-project.git
   git push --mirror https://github.com/cao-ai/your-project.git
   ```

3. Alternatively, you can fork or recreate the repository under the organization and push your local files.

4. Ensure your new repository includes:
   - A `README.md` with a **brief description of the project**, your **name**, and **contact information**.
   - Any usage instructions, dependencies, and citations.

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /models/      # Trained models, weights, architecture
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /docs/        # Thesis, reports, supplementary material
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /handover/    # Instructions, configuration, setup notes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md     # Project summary + contributor info
